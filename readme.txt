This plugin allows users to create lists of different types (simple, numbered, cart and poll) and share them.
The items of these lists are the posts of the types to configure (Ex: post, page, product, other CPT, etc).
Create classic lists like Favorites, Bookmarks, Wish List. Or poll lists like "Which one should I buy?", or shopping cart lists of every month, etc.
It is flexible and extensible.

== Description ==

The plugin adds custom endpoints to the wordpress REST API and includes a client that will display operations on user lists in a modal.

### Default lists types

The plugin comes with 6 types of lists:
* **Simple:** Simple list sorted according to their items added.
* **Numbered:** List with your numbered items. You can edit the order in which the items will be displayed.
* **Poll:** You can ask others for their opinion.
* **Shopping Cart:** List to add items to a virtual cart ( only on Woocommerce ).
* **Favorites** This type of list conceptually always exists for users, that is, the user does not create them but simply adds items.
* **Bookmarks** Equivalent to favorites.

All list types can be disabled.

If you are a developer and you are making a theme you can register your own list types.
