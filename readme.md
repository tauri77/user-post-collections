# User Post Collections

Work in progress. Do not use in production!

This plugin allows users to create lists of different types (simple, numbered and poll) and share them.
Create lists like Favorites and Bookmarks.
It is flexible and extensible.

The plugin add custom endpoints in the wordpress REST API.
It also includes a client for the api developed in preact.

You can add a link, for example to the menu, with the hash "#my-lists", when clicked the client appears on the scene as a modal.

## Reinventing the wheel

The plugin is being developed in an existing database, but the structure is such that it will be simple to pass the lists to a CPT.
